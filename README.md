# Diwali Sales EDA

## Description
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Diwali sales data to uncover insights, trends, and patterns related to consumer purchasing behavior during the festive season. The analysis includes data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to explore factors such as product categories, sales volume, and customer demographics influencing sales during Diwali.

## Required Tools and Libraries
- **Python 3.8+** - Core language for data processing and analysis
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and cleaning
- **NumPy** - Numerical operations for calculations
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** - Visualization tools for plotting sales trends and distributions
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Environment for performing and documenting the EDA

## Features
- Data cleaning to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies
- Data transformation to prepare the dataset for analysis (e.g., aggregating sales by category)
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify top-selling products, peak sales periods, and customer trends
- Visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and line plots to highlight Diwali sales insights

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Ashutosh-Jarag/Diwali-Sales-Data-Analysis.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Place the Diwali sales dataset (e.g., `Diwali Sales Data.csv`) in the projectâ€™s root directory
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Diwali_Sales_EDA.ipynb`) to run the analysis

## Usage
1. Launch the Jupyter Notebook (`Diwali-sales-data-analysis.ipynb`) to:
   - Load and clean the Diwali sales dataset
   - Transform the data (e.g., categorize products, calculate total sales)
   - Perform EDA to explore sales patterns and relationships
   - Generate visualizations for key insights
2. Run the notebook cells to view the cleaned data, analysis results, and plots
